# IC-Hackathon

In this project we went to MUJ University(Manipal University Jaipur), for a hackathon conducted by IEEE all over the India.
Our ideation was based on climate change and transportation solutions.

Our main ideation was to replace coal with biomass as coal produces higher amount of carbon prints and it is also bannned by the Govt. of India in many states. So biomass briquettes and pellets would be the best replacement of coal.

This is a chatbot which was integrated in our website for the buyers like fuel-intensive companies, so it becomes easy for them to know what amount of raw material would be best for their boilers asper it's specifications like GCV, moisture content, ash content etc.

This chat bot model, is trained on the behalf of the data put in it.
